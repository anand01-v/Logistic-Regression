# Logistic-Regression

Logistic Regression is a fundamental and widely used algorithm in the field of machine learning, particularly for binary and multi-class classification tasks.

Despite its name, it's not a regression algorithm in the traditional sense; it's a classification algorithm that predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.  

## Implementation:

- Importing the required libraries and reading the data set.
  
- Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data.
  
- Performing Visualization techniques on the data.

- Encoding the categorical variables.

- Building the logistic regression model on the data.

-  Prediction of the dependent variables by using independent variables.

-  Testing the accuracy of the model.
    - Confusion Matrix
    - ROC Curve

- Identify the insignificant variables.

- Identifying the best Threshold to increase the accuracy of the model.
